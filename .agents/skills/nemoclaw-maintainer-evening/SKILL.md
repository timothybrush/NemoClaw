# NemoClaw Maintainer Evening

Wrap up the day: check progress, identify stragglers, summarize for QA, cut the tag, automatically carry stragglers to the next patch, retire the released label, and prepare release notes for posting.

See [PR-REVIEW-PRIORITIES.md](../nemoclaw-maintainer-day/PR-REVIEW-PRIORITIES.md) for the daily cadence.

## Step 1: Check Progress

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings .agents/skills/nemoclaw-maintainer-day/scripts/version-target.ts
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings .agents/skills/nemoclaw-maintainer-day/scripts/version-progress.ts <version>
```

The first script determines the target version. The second shows shipped vs open. Present the progress summary to the user.

## Step 2: Review Post-Tag Stragglers

```bash
gh pr list --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --state open --label <version> --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,url,labels
gh issue list --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --state open --label <version> --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,url,labels
```

List open labeled PRs and issues as the post-tag housekeeping plan. Tell the maintainer that, after the tag and workflow-managed `latest` are verified, `cut-release-tag` will automatically move all of them to the next patch label and delete the released label.

If an item should leave the daily release flow instead of moving forward, remove it from the released-version label before asking for the release confirmation phrase.

## Step 3: Generate Handoff Summary

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings .agents/skills/nemoclaw-maintainer-day/scripts/handoff-summary.ts
```

This lists commits since the last tag, identifies risky areas touched, and suggests QA test focus areas. Format the output as a concise summary the user can paste into the tag annotation or a handoff channel.

## Pre-Tag Docs

Run `/nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs for <version>` before loading `cut-release-tag`.
Confirm that the release-prep docs PR creates or updates one direct child of `docs/changelog/` for the planned date and contains the exact `## <version>` heading, a parser-safe MDX SPDX comment, the summary, and the detailed release bullets.
An ordinary docs refresh or a post-tag Discussion draft does not satisfy this step.
The release-prep docs PR, including the dated changelog entry, must be merged, or explicitly waived with a reason that names the missing changelog entry, before `release:plan` captures the release commit.
If a docs PR or any other intended PR merges after `release:plan`, regenerate the plan before cutting the tag.

## Step 4: Cut the Tag and Publish Release Notes

Load `cut-release-tag`. The version is already known — default to patch bump, but still show the commit, changelog, post-tag carry-forward and label-retirement plan, and release notes draft for confirmation. After the release plan freezes the candidate SHA, review the pre-tag E2E evidence ledger derived from `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` at that commit. Do not ask for the release confirmation phrase until every test has green evidence or an explicit itemized maintainer exception. NemoClaw releases are tag-based: tag the confirmed release commit with `vX.Y.Z`, let the workflow move `latest`, automatically carry remaining open issues/PRs to the next patch label, delete the released label, and prepare the release notes announcement for the maintainer to post.

## Step 5: Confirm and Share

After the tag is cut and release notes are drafted or posted by the maintainer, present the final summary:

- **Tag**: `v0.0.8` at commit `abc1234`
- **Pre-tag E2E evidence**: 12/13 tests green for the candidate SHA; 1 itemized maintainer exception
- **Release notes draft**: `../nemoclaw-release-v0.0.8/release-note-draft.md`
- **Shipped**: 4 items (#1234, #1235, #1236, #1237)
- **Moved to v0.0.9**: 1 item (#1238 — still needs CI fix)
- **Retired label**: `v0.0.8`
- **QA focus areas**: installer changes, new onboard preset

This summary can be shared in the team's handoff channel.

## Step 6: Update State

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings .agents/skills/nemoclaw-maintainer-day/scripts/state.ts history "tag-cut" "<version>" "shipped N items, carried M forward"
```

## Notes

- Never cut a tag or hand off release notes without user confirmation.
- If nothing was labeled or nothing shipped, ask whether to skip the tag today.
- A PR version label activates release work; it is not a readiness claim.
- If an open item misses the tag, post-tag housekeeping moves its target to the next patch version.
- After carry-forward succeeds, post-tag housekeeping deletes the released label; never rename or reuse it.
